# The Topic Engine

The Topic Engine is an open-source distributed content intelligence system that enables autonomous discovery, monitoring, and processing of topic-specific content across the internet. It transforms unstructured web content into structured, actionable intelligence by understanding content patterns, site structures, and topic relevance.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Intelligent Content Discovery**: Autonomous identification and monitoring of relevant content sources
- **Smart Content Processing**: Advanced content extraction with fallback strategies
- **Topic Classification**: Efficient few-shot learning for content categorization
- **Structured Data Extraction**: Turn unstructured content into actionable data
- **Geographic Context**: Location-aware content processing and analysis
- **Extensible Architecture**: Plugin-based design for easy customization

## 🚀 Vision

The Topic Engine aims to be more than just a content processing system - it's a step towards democratizing content intelligence and enabling personal AI systems. Our goals include:

- Creating an open, collaborative platform for content processing and analysis
- Enabling individuals and small teams to build sophisticated content monitoring systems
- Fostering a community-driven approach to content intelligence
- Supporting the development of personal AI assistants and tools

## 🛠 Technical Overview

The Topic Engine is built with:

- Django for the core framework
